## FAQ ‚ùì

#### In which browsers are supported?
I alredy try this extension en Chrome, Microsft Edge. But if you wanna try on your browser maybe will work if your browser is chromium-based (If you try on your browser, please open a pull request to change this section ‚ù§Ô∏è)

#### I need an Adblocker?

Yep! This extension is only to block that PopUp. I tried with [Adguard Extension](https://adguard.com/es/welcome.html) and works fine!

#### Why you don't publish it on Chrome Web Store? 

Easy, projects like [FastForward](https://github.com/FastForwardTeam/FastForward) (A chrome extension to bypass shorteners) get down on Chrome Web Store due it "Bypasses payment" (Which is not true), so maybe this project will get down if publish it on Chrome Web Store.
