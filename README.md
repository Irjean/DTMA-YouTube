## FAQ ❓

#### Which browsers are supported?

This extension has been successfully tested on Chrome and Microsoft Edge. However, if you would like to try it on another browser, it might work if the browser is Chromium-based. If you do try it on another browser, please open a pull request to update this information – we'd appreciate it ❤️.

#### Do I need an Adblocker with this project?

Yep! This extension is only to block the YouTube anti-adblock PopUp. I tried with [Adguard Extension](https://adguard.com/es/welcome.html) and works fine!

#### Why isn't it published on the Chrome Web Store?

Projects such as [FastForward](https://github.com/FastForwardTeam/FastForward) (a Chrome extension designed to bypass shorteners) have been removed from the Chrome Web Store due to accusations of "bypassing payments," which are uncorrect. Therefore, there's a risk that this project could be taken down as well if it were published on the Chrome Web Store.

#### Can I support this project?

Yeah! ❤️ Every contribution to improve this project and help the community is welcome. Check out [Contributing](https://github.com/iSaulX/DTMA-YouTube/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for further intructions.
